-- MySQL CROSS JOIN
-- Result set will include all rows from both tables, where each row is the combination of the rows in the first
-- table with the row in second table. 
-- Returns cartesian product

-- Total result will be 6 x 4 = 24

-- Write a query to fetch all employee name and their coressponding department name .Â 
-- Also make sure to display the company name and company location corresponding to each employee

-- SELF JOIN
-- It joins a table with itself using either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. 
-- Self join can also be done using where clause.
