Introduction to DataWarehouse:

1.) DWH is built by combining data rom multiple sources (variety of data) and that supports Analytical Reporting.

Fact VS Dimension Table :

*. A fact table contains measurement, facts, foreign keys, to dimension table. Fact Table is primary table in dimension table.
*. A dimension table contains dimension of fact table. Comapanion table to fact table that contains descriptive attributes to be used as query.
   How dimension table is joined to fact table -> foreign keys
   Dimension table can also contain one or more hierarchical relationship.

Keys :-
*. Primary key in fact table is mapped as foreign key to dimension table.
*. Dimension table has primary key column that uniquely identifies each dimension.

Design :-
*. Fact table is defined by their grain or its most atomic level.
*. Dimension Table should be wordly, discriptive, complete and quality assured.

Fact table contains keys.

STAR vs SNOWFLAKE schema :

*. A star schema has denormalized dimension tables, while a snowflake schema has normalized dimension tables.
*. A star schema is easier to design and implement than a snowflake schema.
*. A star schema can be more efficient to query than a snowflake schema, because there are fewer JOINs between tables.
