DBMS is:
*. File system 
*. Stand alone - it cannot be shared in the network.
	       - it can't be client server architecture so cannot make enterprise applications.
	       - 

database - operaional system
datawarehouse - management system 
Datawarehouse does not require any unique value.

Granularity in datawarehouse - it tells the level of analysis we need to do (hourly, weekly, monthly basis)


*. Log files are generated only when client server architecture wants it.

select statement does -> parsing execution fetching
parsing goes to metadata 
execution happens in memory
fetching is done by cursor.

metadata is most important.

- Dimension model refers to datawarehouse. 

Kimball theory :
* Select business process
* Declare the grain (Granularity)
* Choose dimension 
* Identify facts

- Fact table is the summaried data that is stored in a star schema under data mart.
- A data mart can consist of one or multiple star schema.
- Dimension are descriptive in nature which are part of star schema.

- Data collected in fact table is historic.

- Mapping is a set of instruction
- 

Inmon theory

Time Dimension:-
- It is used to define granularity level.
- Granularity is based on redunduncy factor.
